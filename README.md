If you aren't a dev installation should be simple and self explanatory. If not google is your new best friend

# Dev Installation

This is my theme, it is a dark theme with green. I chose to tone down most colours while amplifying the syntax highlighting to make the code pop out.

### Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:

    npm install -g @vscode/vsce

# Usage

### You can use vsce to easily package and publish your extensions:

    $ cd myExtension
    $ vsce package

    # myExtension.vsix generated

    $ vsce publish

    # <publisherID>.myExtension published to VS Code Marketplace

# TODO

- add an Icon
- publisher name
- do it
